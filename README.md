# ForgottenEmpires

Forgotten Empires is an onchain game built on the Mina Protocol and based on zk-proof technology. Some in-game actions are transactions on the Mina blockchain with changes captured by a prover-server. Prover server also builds and maintains a Merkle tree, interfacing directly with the game server.
